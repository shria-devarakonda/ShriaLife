# ShriaLife Developer Logs

--1
This repository is to help me (and maybe others) to codify life. It has an classes that could broadly logically hold methods for different things we might come up in life. It takes input and gives out an output. Input types are sensory and actions, output types are actions. I will go deeper in levels to make sense of what is happening here but it would be an evolving process. Running this might have a purpose in the future but currently it is just for me, to figure things out. I dont know what to use this for, really. However, I will develop a resilient as heck cache, thats for sure. 

--2
I am trying to codify what i must do for each types of actions. Because i've done a not so great job so far at doing that automatically, but writing this might help fix my actions as response to things things that I was not realizing I was doing and harming myself.


--3
I should have updateable obejcts for my mood level or motivation here. For sures


--4
I need a design diagram. i might be making a mindmap but let's see


--5
I just realised I might add an action to do something that might be fulfilling too, and it will be upping my status of fulfillment, confidence etc
i def need statuses for each subsections of my psyche. god. more classes to make


--6
should i do a status class or maintain different classes for each status that inherits from a base status class, i wonder...


--7
i need a heckin diagram im getting confused

--8
so the person is the entire codebase basically, only one external component which is the action publisher which is where an action gets performed towards me, but that could also be self inflicted maybe. i should keep this self contained probably and maintain a queue for external actions on me and one for internal actions on me


--9
adding personalitytraits, that get updated with the statuses? i wonder. i really need to make that diagram


--10
i love developing something without a clear goal on what the end product would be. it feels like it could evolve into anything i desire
